      <h2 class="header">AMHI’s Psychedelic-Facilitator Training Program</h2>

      <p class="article">The Alfred M. Hubbard Institute educates psychedelic facilitators to work in Oregon’s licensed psilocybin-service centers or similar settings elsewhere. Oregon Psilocybin Services (OPS) is a section of the Oregon Health Authority. OPS approved AMHI’s curriculum as meeting the requirements for our graduates to apply for a psilocybin-facilitator license.</p>

      <p class="article">The Alfred M. Hubbard Institute is commonly known as AMHI (pronounced "am hi"). AMHI’s psilocybin-facilitator training program teaches students about society’s changing attitudes towards psychedelics. AMHI also imparts an understanding of the legal requirements for psilocybin facilitators. And most importantly, AMHI teaches a firm foundation of the actual process of facilitation.</p>

      <p class="article">AMHI training not only teaches the art of facilitation, it also emphasizes developing critical-thinking skills, good writing skills, and public-speaking ability. In other words, we want to produce facilitators who are good at thinking and communicating. Due to today’s declining educational standards, even many licensed professionals who went through graduate school have weak writing ability and are shy about public speaking. AMHI realizes that you may need gentle guidance to help develop your critical-thinking skills so that you can effectively analyze evidence, figure out logical interpretations about the known facts, and arrive at rational  conclusions about the entire situation. Therefore, AMHI training involves having robust discussions in order to debate concepts. We give our students the opportunity to practice articulating their ideas both verbally and in writing, within a comfortable and low-pressure environment.</p>

      <ul>
        <li> Meet our educators:</li>
        <li> Director of Education: Nikki Johnson: Currently enrolled in a Ph.D. Psychology program.</li>
        <li> Lead Educator: Kristy Martin: Has taught college courses in economics, statistics, and molecular biology.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="header"><b>Schedule for the Spring, Summer, and Fall in 2025</b></h2>
      <p class="article">The program will have three cohorts in 2025, each running for 17 weeks during a four-month period. Each of the first 16 weeks will consist of 3.5 hours of online classes and 3.5 hours of self-study (reading the textbook, writing an occasional essay) per week. The final week will wrap up the coursework, and will entail preparing for and taking the final exam. This will prepare the student to pass Oregon’s state-licensing exam. The classes are scheduled to accommodate students who work. In order to provide some flexibility, students can attend either two weekday classes or a single Sunday class. Both sections cover the same course content. Even if you ordinarily attend one section, if something comes up in a given week you are welcome to attend the other section.</p> Each of the first 11 weeks will have 3.5 hours of self-study and 3.5 hours of online classes held in the evenings on either two weekdays or on Sunday. The final week will be preparing for, and then taking, the final exam. This will prepare the student to pass the state exam.</p>

      <p class="article">AMHI’s Spring cohort will run from January 5 till April 27. The Summer cohort will run from May 3, 2025 and ending on August 23. The Winter cohort will be from September 6 to December 3.</li>

      <h2 class="header">The AMHI Curriculum</h2>

      <p class="article">Our 124-hour coursework is conducted online. The AMHI curriculum conforms to the legal requirements of the Oregon Psilocybin Services Act by providing 120 hours of instruction on these nine topics:</p>

      <ul class="article-list">
         <li> (a) Historical, traditional, and contemporary practices and applications: 12 hours.</li>
         <li> (b) Cultural equity in relation to psilocybin services: 12 hours.</li>
         <li> (c) Safety, ethics, and responsibilities: 12 hours.</li>
        < li> (d) Psilocybin pharmacology, neuroscience, and clinical research: 4 hours</li>
         <li> (e) Core facilitation skills: 16 hours.</li>
         <li> (f) Preparation and orientation: 16 hours.</li>
         <li> (g) Administration: 20 hours.</li>
         <li> (h) Integration; 12 hours.</li>
         <li> (i) Group facilitation: 16 hours.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="article">AMHI also offers an additional four hours of training on the use of psychedelics for enhancing creativity, learning skills, and solving technical problems.</p>

      <p class="article">Our 40-hour practicum consists of one or two in-person meetings. This satisfies Oregon's requirement that students observe facilitation or view films of facilitation. AMHI is now accepting applications for students who wish to study during the final quarter of 2024 or during the first four months of 2025.</p>
      <p class="article">Sometime in 2025, AMHI hopes to expand its program to 155 hours spread out over four months. We intend this expanded curriculum to conform to both Oregon’s Psilocybin Services Act and the requirements of Colorado’s Natural Medicine Health Program. The AMHI program intends to apply for approval in Colorado as preparation for the opening of “natural-medicine healing centers” in that state.</p>
