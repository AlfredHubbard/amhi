      <h2 class="header">Our Psychedelic-Facilitator Training Program</h2>

      <p class="article">The Alfred M. Hubbard Institute is commonly known as AMHI (pronounced “am hi”). AMHI educates psychedelic facilitators to work in Oregon’s licensed psilocybin-service centers or similar settings elsewhere. Oregon Psilocybin Services (OPS) is a section of the Oregon Health Authority. OPS approved AMHI’s curriculum as meeting the requirements for our graduates to apply for a psilocybin-facilitator license.</p>

      <p class="article">AMHI’s psilocybin-facilitator training program teaches students about society’s changing attitudes towards psychedelics. AMHI also imparts an understanding of the legal requirements for psilocybin facilitators. And most importantly, AMHI teaches a firm foundation of the actual process of facilitation.</p>

      <p class="article">AMHI training not only teaches the art of facilitation, it also emphasizes developing critical-thinking skills, good writing skills, and public-speaking ability. In other words, we want to produce facilitators who are good at thinking and communicating. Due to today’s declining educational standards, even many licensed professionals who went through graduate school have weak writing ability and are shy about public speaking. AMHI realizes that you may need help in developing your critical-thinking skills so that you can effectively analyze evidence, figure out logical interpretations about the known facts, and arrive at rational  conclusions about the entire situation. Therefore, AMHI training involves having discussions in order to debate concepts. We give our students the opportunity to practice articulating their ideas both verbally and in writing.</p>

      <h2 class="header">The AMHI Curriculum</h2>

      <p class="article">Our 124-hour coursework is conducted online. The AMHI curriculum conforms to the legal requirements of the Oregon Psilocybin Services Act by providing 120 hours of instruction on these nine topics:</p>

      <ul class="article-list">
        <li>(a) Historical, traditional, and contemporary practices and applications: 12 hours.</li>
        <li>(b) Cultural equity in relation to psilocybin services: 12 hours.</li>
        <li>(c) Safety, ethics, and responsibilities: 12 hours.</li>
        <li>(d) Psilocybin pharmacology, neuroscience, and clinical research: 4 hours</li>
        <li>(e) Core facilitation skills: 16 hours.</li>
        <li>(f) Preparation and orientation: 16 hours.</li>
        <li>(g) Administration: 20 hours.</li>
        <li>(h) Integration; 12 hours.</li>
        <li>(i) Group facilitation: 16 hours.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="article">AMHI also offers an additional four hours of training on the use of psychedelics for enhancing creativity, learning skills, and solving technical problems.</p>

      <p class="article">Our 40-hour practicum consists of one or two in-person meetings for experiential hands-on training in facilitation. AMHI is now accepting applications for students who wish to study during the final quarter of 2024 or during the first four months of 2025.</p>
