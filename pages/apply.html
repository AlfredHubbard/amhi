    <h1 class="header">Preparation for Applying to the AMHI Program</h1>

    <h2 class="header2">Attend a Question-and-Answer Online Meeting</h2>
    <p class="article">Potential applicants will be instructed to thoroughly familiarize themselves with the contents of the AMHI website including AMHI’s FAQ page and our academic-freedom policy. Potential applicants should write out in advance any questions that they want to ask about the program. AMHI will hold online meetings to explain our program and to enable the public to ask questions.</p>

    <h2 class="header2">Textbook</h2>
    <p class="article">The primary textbook for AMHI’s training program will be Stanislav Grof’s LSD Psychotherapy. The subjective psychological effects of LSD are very similar to those of psilocybin, and the psychotherapeutic techniques that Grof describes can be easily adapted to the “wellness” treatments offered by Oregon’s licensed psilocybin-service centers. This book can be purchased from the MAPS.org online bookstore or on Amazon. If you purchase your textbook and send us a copy of your receipt, then we will deduct this expenditure from your tuition if you are accepted to our school, so you would end up getting the book for free. AMHI advises prospective students to begin reading this textbook now. This textbook will give you a clearer idea of whether psychedelic facilitation is a career that appeals to you. Additionally, prior familiarity with the contents of this textbook will reduce your workload during the training program, should you continue the application process and be accepted into the program.</p>

    <h2 class="header2">Equipment</h2>

    <div class="article">Students will be required to maintain and regularly monitor a valid, usable, and live email address to which AMHI can send documents and notifications. Additionally, all students and staff will need a functioning modern laptop or tablet with a functioning camera. We will be conducting online meetings in which it is necessary for AMHI instructors to visually confirm the students’ attendance throughout the entire class. Students will type essays on their laptops, and we will use screenshare functionality to broadcast presentations and to correct student essays. A cell phone is inadequate for this sort of online activity.</div>

    <h2 class="header2">AMHI Student Handbook</h2>
    <p class="articcle">Applicants should read the AMHI Student Handbook. If accepted to the program, you will have to follow the rules and procedures in this booklet.</p> 

    <h2 class="header2">AMHI’s Four-Step Application Process</h2>
    <p class="article">AMHI’s application process involves four steps:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Evaluation of Applicant Essays</li>
      <li>Brief Video Statement</li>
      <li>Online Interview</li>
      <li>Delivery of acceptance letter</li>
      <li>At each of the first three steps of the process, AMHI may decline to proceed further with some applicants. </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="header">Step 1: Written Essays</h2>

    <p class="article">The first step in your application will be writing six essays so AMHI can evaluate your writing skills and abstract-reasoning ability. Your essay should be long enough for you to get your point across, no shorter and no lengthier.</p>
    <p class="article">Psilocybin is a psychedelic drug whose subjective effects are very similar to those of other classical hallucinogens such as LSD, DMT, and mescaline. MDMA is not a hallucinogen although it does have mind-expanding properties that are used both in psychotherapy and recreationally. The first three of the following writing exercises will discuss a psychedelic substance or MDMA. The fourth and fifth exercises deal with a topic from psychology or sociology. The final essay asks you to compare content from the previous exercises. </p>

    <p class="article">You will not be penalized for expressing noncomformist opinions. Your essays will be evaluated for logical thought, clarity of expression, cleverness of wording, rhetorical persuasiveness, overall structure of your composition, your thoroughness in evaluating the available evidence, as well as any shortcomings in your adherence to proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation. You should use a spellchecker and a dictionary. If you are not adept with proper punctuation, then use a style guide such as Byran A. Garner’s The Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style. </p>

    <p class="article">If you have any questions about these instructions, then please email AMHI so we can clarify what you are expected to do.</p>

    <h3 class="header2">Essay 1:</h3>

    <p class="article">View this short satirical video:</p>
    <p class="article"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD1S6CYCqkQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD1S6CYCqkQ</a></p>

    <p class="article">Despite its low-brow humor, this entertaining film raises some serious questions that you can answer in your first essay:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What qualities do you believe that a psychedelic facilitator should have?</li>
      <li>Do you think some personality types could more easily embody these qualities than others?</li>
      <li>What personal qualities do you possess would help you to become an excellent facilitator?</li>
      <li>What personal qualities might you need to improve in order to increase your effectiveness as a facilitator?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="header2">Essay 2:</h3>

    <p class="article">Psychedelics can produce pleasant and even blissful experiences. However, we must recognize that they can also bring out difficult emotions. Facilitators have a serious responsibility to properly screen clients and to skillfully manage both individual sessions and group sessions. Facilitators must take all reasonable precautions to protect the safety of themselves, their clients, and other people who may be impacted both during and after the session in which the drug is administered. Read the “Case History” section of the medical report about an administration session gone awry. This session occurred in the context of an indigenous religious ritual, but the lessons that can be learned apply equally to what goes on in a licensed psilocybin-service center. Describe how the session was likely to have been traumatic for everybody involved: the culprit, the victim, the innocent bystanders, and the Road Man (the ceremonial leader of the Native American Church meeting). Your essay should discuss the ethical issues and legal considerations from the standpoint of all of these participants? What lessons might be learned from this tragedy?</p>

    <h3 class="header2">Essay 3:</h3>

    <p class="article">Oregon’s Psilocybin Services Act requires facilitator-training programs to teach a 12-hour social-equity “module”. Social equity involves discussing racial topics such as microaggressions. If you have never heard of the concept of microaggression, please look it up online. </p>

    <p class="article">In the article “Culture and Psychedelic Psychotherapy”, the co-author Jamilah R. George described a White therapist committing a microaggressions by saying, “Maybe there is a part of you that doesn’t want to be understood.” [p. 130, pdf page 6] Please explain how this statement was a racist comment.</p>

    <p class="article">According to this article, “Women of color are among the most stigmatized groups of people in North America” [p. 129, pdf page 5] and Black patients can be injured by “violence from clinicians in the form of microaggressions” [p. 133, pdf page 9]. Do you think these statements are accurate? Explain why or why not.</p>

    <p class="article">Express your honest opinion of the authors’ arguments. You will not be penalized for whatever viewpoint you take; your evaluation on this task will be based solely on the quality of your thought, the rigor of your logical reasoning, and the intellectual honesty of your analysis. </p>

    <p class="article">Would you feel comfortable acting as a facilitator for any of the three authors? Explain in detail why or why not.</p>


    <h3 class="header2">Essay 4:</h3>
    <p class="article">The social-equity model proposes that socioeconomic disparities between different demographic groups are due to racism by Whites against other. Additionally, the social-equity model asserts that socioeconomic disparities between nations are due to European colonialism and capitalist exploitation.</p>

    <p class="article">Smart-fraction theory proposes that the intelligence structure of a population is the most important factor in determining the socioeconomic attainment of a nation or an ethnicity within a nation. According to smart-fraction theory, 57% of the variation in socioeconomic performance of nations is due to differences in the national average IQ, whereas 66% of the socioeconomic variation between nations is due to the intelligence level of the cognitive elite (meaning the top 5% of a country’s population).</p>

    <p class="article">Read the Abstract and the Discussion section in the following article about smart-fraction theory [pp. 677, 692-694; pdf pages 2, 17-19]. Explain the authors’ theory about smart fractions and its implications for society. Do you think that the authors are correct? Do you think this theory should be taught in educational institutions and used as the basis for public policy? You may write as lengthy and detailed an essay as you wish. You may go online to gather additional evidence to bolster your arguments. Please cite your sources of outside information either in footnotes or by incorporating the sources as bracketed references in your text.</p>

    <h3 class="header2">Essay 5:</h3>

    <p class="article">The book chapter about marriage in this exercise contains opinions that some people would regard as old-fashioned. Nevertheless, ruminating about unusual viewpoints is a useful mental exercise. Try to find flaws in the author’s arguments. If you are unable to debunk his opinions, then are you willing to accept his ideas as valid?</p>

    <h3 class="header2">Essay 6:</h3>

    <p class="article">Horizons (<a href="https://www.horizonspbc.com" target="_blank">https://www.horizonspbc.com</a>) hosts annual psychedelic conferences in New York City and Portland, Oregon. Please read the Horizons Code of Conduct & Safer Space Policy. Then re-read the AMHI Academic-Freedom Policy. Write an essay about these three points:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A) Comment on any similarities or differences in the content of these two policies.</li>
      <li>B) Speculate on how Horizons might treat each of the authors of the articles used in Essay 3 (microagressions), Essay 4 (smart-fraction theory), and Essay 5 (marriage).</li>
      <li>C) Presuming that any of these authors wanted to get training to become a psilocybin facilitator, which of them do you think would be happy studying at the AMHI program? Which do you think would be better suited to attending a program at some other school that has a different orientation? Explain why you think this.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="header">Step 2: Brief Video Statement</h2>

    <p class="article">Send us a video no longer than three minutes. In the video, the applicant should discuss something relevant to their desire to become a psychedelic facilitator. You can either email a video attachment or send us a link to a YouTube video that you uploaded.</p>

    <h2 class="header">Step 3: Online Interview</h2>

    <p class="article">After reviewing the applicants’ essays and video statements, AMHI staff will conduct brief online interviews with those applicants who seem like they might be a good fit for our program. The interview will be an informal, friendly conversation geared toward assessing whether the applicant should be accepted to the AMHI program. Is the applicant able to handle the coursework? Why does the applicant want to work as a facilitator? Is the applicant’s general life situation conducive to undergoing AMHI training at the present time? Does the applicant’s worldview and personal values align with those being advanced by the AMHI program?</p>

    <p class="article">The interview will also explore the applicant’s previous personal experience with mind-expanding substances. Everybody working with psychedelics now recognizes that some personal experience is necessary for a facilitator to understand what clients are dealing with. However, an individual with only only a few personal experiences may have delved more deeply into the process than another person who has had hundreds of experiences. If an otherwise qualified applicant has never used a psychedelic substance, then AMHI will encourage the applicant seek professional facilitation for a supervised session unless there are contraindications. We can discuss how to get you up to speed as far as personal experiences.</p>

    <h2 class="header">Step 4: Paperwork</h2>

    <p class="article">Successful applicants will receive a letter of acceptance whose terms are contingent upon paying tuition and agreeing to follow the stipulations in the AMHI Student Handbook.</p>

    <p class="article">Applicants who are accepted to the AMHI program will be emailed a dated letter signed by a AMHI staff member. This letter will state that the applicant is accepted to the program for a cohort that begins on such-and-such date.</p>
