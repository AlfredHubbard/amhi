    <h1 class="header">Psychedelic Facilitation with Psilocybin</h1>
    
    <p class="article">People from all over the world can benefit from AMHI’s program, which is not limited to Oregon residents. There are many different types of jobs in the emerging psychedelic ecosystem: online integration counseling, working at VA hospitals, academic positions in colleges and universities, working in churches, as well as performing facilitation anywhere in the world. AMHI’s program would be useful for people interested in any of these occupations.</p>
    
    <p>Oregon Psilocybin Services (OPS) is a section of Oregon Health Authority. This state agency authorizes members of the public to have supervised psychedelic sessions at licensed service centers. Licensed facilitators offer clients the opportunity to undergo <u>preparation sessions</u>. If it looks like a good fit, then the facilitator will offer the client an <u>administration session</u> in which the client is administered <i>Psilocybe</i> mushrooms, extracted psilocybin, or food containing psilocybin. Afterward, the facilitator will offer at least one <u>integration session</u> to discuss the client’s psychedelic experience.</p>

    <p class="article">Oregon Psilocybin Services approved the Alfred M. Hubbard Institute (AMHI) to train facilitators. After completing our coursework and practicum, our students will graduate from AMHI’s training program, thus fulfilling OPS’s educational requirement for licensure.</p>

    <p class="article">Residents of other states may apply for Oregon’s psilocybin-facilitator license. An Oregon license can be useful as a credential to work doing facilitation in other states or to get a job in academia. In order to qualify for a license, the applicant must meet these requirements:</p>

    <ol>
      <li> 1) Be at least 21 years old.</li>
      <li> 2) Have at least a high-school education.</li>
      <li> 3) Must pass a criminal-background check.</li>
      <li> 4) Have graduated from a training program such as AMHI that is approved by Oregon Psilocybin Services (OPS).</li>
      <li> 5) Must pass an exam administered by Oregon Psilocybin Services</li>
      <li> 6) Must submit an application and a $150 application fee.</li>
      <li> 7) Submit a social-equity plan to OPS</li>
      <li> 8) Pay a $2,000 annual license fee to OPS.</li>
      <li> 9) In order to be employed in a psilocybin-service center in Oregon, a licensed facilitator must be legally entitled to work in the United States.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="article">AMHI will prepare students to pass the state exam. We will also help alumni write a social-equity plan.</p>

      <h2 class="header">AMHI’s Psychedelic-Facilitator Training Program</h2>

      <p class="article">The Alfred M. Hubbard Institute educates psychedelic facilitators to work in Oregon’s licensed psilocybin-service centers or similar settings elsewhere. Oregon Psilocybin Services (OPS) is a section of the Oregon Health Authority. OPS approved AMHI’s curriculum as meeting the requirements for our graduates to apply for a psilocybin-facilitator license.</p>

      <p class="article">The Alfred M. Hubbard Institute is commonly known as AMHI (pronounced "am hi"). AMHI’s psilocybin-facilitator training program teaches students about society’s changing attitudes towards psychedelics. AMHI also imparts an understanding of the legal requirements for psilocybin facilitators. And most importantly, AMHI teaches a firm foundation of the actual process of facilitation.</p>

      <p class="article">AMHI training not only teaches the art of facilitation, it also emphasizes developing critical-thinking skills, good writing skills, and public-speaking ability. In other words, we want to produce facilitators who are good at thinking and communicating. Due to today’s declining educational standards, even many licensed professionals who went through graduate school have weak writing ability and are shy about public speaking. AMHI realizes that you may need gentle guidance to help develop your critical-thinking skills so that you can effectively analyze evidence, figure out logical interpretations about the known facts, and arrive at rational  conclusions about the entire situation. Therefore, AMHI training involves having robust discussions in order to debate concepts. We give our students the opportunity to practice articulating their ideas both verbally and in writing, within a comfortable and low-pressure environment.</p>

      <p class="article">AMHI's tuition is $3,000 for the coursework and $1,000 for the practicum.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li> Meet our educators:</li>
        <li> Director of Education: Nikki Johnson is currently enrolled in a Ph.D. psychology program.</li>
        <li> Lead Educator: Elene Johas Teener is an Oregon psilocybin facilitator and has been a licensed clinical social worker for over 40 years.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="header"><b>Schedule for our final bootcamp session of 2025 and Spring 2026</b></h2>

      <p class="article"><b>We will have a small class size and will work with the students to figure out the most convenient time for them to schedule class.</b>
     
      <h2 class="header">The AMHI Curriculum</h2>
